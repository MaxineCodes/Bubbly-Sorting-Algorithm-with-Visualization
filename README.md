# Visualized Bubble Sorting Algorithm
 Basic and bubbly sorting algorithm but with pretty visualization.

 This was written in C++ with the SFML library to help with the graphical elements.
 This was just a little excersize to become a little more proficient in C++, as I tried to rely less on outside sources and instead code in whatever way came up to me.
